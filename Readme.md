# Furnisher

You have an application.  It's ready to move into to a home you chose for it (like a production server).  

But an unfurnished home would make any owner uncomfortable...

Furnishers goal is to allow you to create nice comfortable homes for your applications.

## What Furnisher is
It is a platform for working with server configurations in a way that is more application centric.  
It let's you say things like "my Customer MongoDB lives here" in code while supporting other configuration.
It's Node and leverages things that Node developers use all the time like NPM, Mocha, etc.
It provides hooks for orchestration and simple configuration for cases where scripting isn't really wanted.
